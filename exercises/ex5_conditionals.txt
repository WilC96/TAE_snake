Snakes Game
Exercise 5 - Conditionals

Goal: Use conditionals to complete the snakes game!

Description: In this exercise, we will complete the game logic to
detect snake collisions, grow the snake, place the apple.

Instructions:
  1) Open GameExercises.java
  2) Modify onTimer to call the following methods:
    a) checkApple
      - If the snake is on the apple tile, then increase the snake length
      and move the apple.
    b) checkBoundsCollision
      - Check for collision w/ walls or the snake with itself
    c) moveSnake
      - Advance the snake in the direction it's currently moving
  3) onKeyPress
    - Change the direction of the snake.  Note that if the snake is already
    traveling up, it cannot immediately turn down, it can only go left or
    right.
