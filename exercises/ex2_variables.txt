Snakes Game
Exercise 2 - Variables

Goal: Practice defining and using variables and simple array.

Description: In this exercise, we will draw a snake that is 4 squares long.

Instructions:
  1) Open GameExercises.java
  2) Modify the method redrawCanvas to draw a green snake
    a) To draw the snake, draw 4 green squares with a little space between
       the squares
  3) Change the snake width
    a) Instead of modifying the width everywhere, create a variable called
       snakeWidth.
    b) Set the snakeWidth variable to different values and choose a good
       width for the snake.
  4) Change the snake color
    a) Instead of modifying the color everywhere, create a variable called
       snakeColor.
    b) Set the snakeColor variable to different colors.
  5) Store the snake in an array
    a) Create two integer arrays (int[] x, int[] y) to store the coordinates
       of the squares that form the snake.
    b) Refactor the snake drawing code so that it uses the array to get the
       snake coordinates.
